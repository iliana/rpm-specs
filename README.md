Sometimes I need to make changes to specfiles. I put them here so I don't lose track of them.

## Licensing

Unless otherwise noted, specfiles are from Fedora or RPM Fusion.

[Fedora guidelines state](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main#License_of_Fedora_SPEC_Files):

> All original Fedora contributions are governed by the [Fedora Project Contributor Agreement (FPCA)](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement). This means that unless a spec file contains an explicit license attribution within it, it is available under the terms of the MIT license.
>
> Since every Fedora SPEC file is contributed by FPCA signers, every Fedora SPEC is available under these license terms (unless otherwise explicitly licensed).

It is suggested that [RPM Fusion follows the same guidelines](https://lists.rpmfusion.org/pipermail/rpmfusion-developers/2013-July/015244.html).
